    <h2>about the server owner</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Nixten Leo Kame, and I’m a 15-year-old furry and developer. I’m the proud owner of this server and the domain name nixten.ddns.net. This project is inspired by <a href="https://e621.net">e621.net</a>, and I decided to create my own unique version of it to bring the community something special.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>Road to Creation</h3>
    <br>
    <p>After several days of planning the site’s design and features—and countless hours fine-tuning the styles—I was finally ready to start coding the core pages. To streamline the process, I used <a href="https://www.chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a> for assistance with both page development and database structuring.</p>

    <p>I built nearly <strong>99.9%</strong> of the site using <strong>PHP</strong>, ensuring flexibility and scalability. For the <strong>user database</strong>, I utilized <strong>MySQL Workbench</strong> to design and create the necessary tables, then set up the <strong>file upload system</strong> using MySQL.</p>

    <p>As I progressed, ChatGPT played a crucial role in writing almost <strong>90%</strong> of the site’s code. However, as my knowledge expanded, I relied on it less—around <strong>50%</strong>—primarily for troubleshooting. Once the site was complete, I migrated my root website from <strong>port 80 to port 8443</strong> to free up <strong>port 80</strong> for Yiff-Fox, now a key project in my lineup.</p>

    <br>
